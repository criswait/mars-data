# Project Overview
This project involves scraping weather data from Mars, specifically from the Curiosity roverâ€™s transmissions, and performing data analysis on temperature, pressure, and other atmospheric conditions. The project demonstrates web scraping techniques, data cleaning, and visualization to explore seasonal patterns on Mars.

# Data Source
The data was scraped from a static Mars weather webpage using Splinter and BeautifulSoup. The data includes:
- Minimum temperature
- Atmospheric pressure
- Terrestrial date (Earth days)
- Martian sol (Martian day)

# Tools Used
- Python: The programming language used for data collection and analysis.
- BeautifulSoup: Used for parsing the HTML and scraping the data from the webpage.
- Splinter: Used for automating browser actions and interacting with the webpage.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: Used for visualizing the data.

# Features
- Web Scraping: Extracts data from the Mars weather webpage.
- Data Analysis: Calculates and analyzes minimum temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and the Martian year.
- Data Visualization: Plots bar charts for temperature and pressure across different Martian months.
- CSV Export: Writes the processed data to a CSV file for further analysis.

# Visualizations
- Minimum Temperature by Month: Bar chart showing the average minimum temperature for each Martian month.
- Atmospheric Pressure by Month: Bar chart showing the average atmospheric pressure for each Martian month.
- Martian Year Cycles: Plot of daily minimum temperatures to visualize the length of a Martian year.

# Data Output
The processed data will be saved in the repository folder as:
mars_weather_data.csv
